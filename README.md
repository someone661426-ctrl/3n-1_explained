The Collatz (3n+1) Process Using the One's Digit — Explained in Words
Start with any number you want.
(You can start with 0, 14, 15, or any other non-negative integer.)

If the number is 0:

By this explanation, 0 is considered to immediately enter the repeating cycle: 4 → 2 → 1.
So, for 0, you just say: “0 goes to 4, then 2, then 1, and then repeats forever.”
For any other number:

Look at the last digit of the number (the one’s digit).
For example, if your number is 14, the one’s digit is 4. If your number is 15, the one’s digit is 5.

Check if the one’s digit is even or odd:

The even digits are 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.
The odd digits are 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9.
If the one’s digit is even:

Divide the whole number by 2.
For example, 14’s one’s digit is 4 (which is even), so you divide 14 by 2 and get 7.
If the one’s digit is odd:

Multiply the whole number by 3, then add 1.
For example, 15’s one’s digit is 5 (which is odd), so you do 3 × 15 + 1 = 46.
Repeat:

Take your new number and repeat the process: look at the one’s digit again, check if it’s even or odd, and do the corresponding operation.
Eventually, you will reach the number 1.

After that, you will always go to 4, then 2, then 1 again, making a cycle (4 → 2 → 1 → 4 → 2 → 1...).
Examples:

Starting with 14:
14’s one’s digit is 4 (even), so 14 ÷ 2 = 7.
7’s one’s digit is 7 (odd), so 3 × 7 + 1 = 22.
22’s one’s digit is 2 (even), so 22 ÷ 2 = 11.
11’s one’s digit is 1 (odd), so 3 × 11 + 1 = 34.
...keep going until you reach 1, then cycle through 4, 2, 1.
Starting with 0:
0 is considered to immediately go to the 4 → 2 → 1 cycle.
